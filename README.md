# React Redux Tailwind Typescript Project

I used create-react-app to start this project with `--template typescript` to setup the latter from the get-go. Then added tailwind and dependencies to avoid the need to write any custom css.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
